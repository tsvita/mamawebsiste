cookieDescription = {
  "milkchoco" : "Milk chocolate provides notes of caramel to this classic cookie.  It is caky on the inside and crisp on the edges. The flavors are heightened by sea salt.",
  "ricekrispie" : "This is what every sugar cookie wants to be - buttery, crunchy and addictive. The richness of the cookie is balanced by a bit of salt.  Makes a wonderful ice cream sandwich!",
  "peanutmiso" : "Umami meets peanut butter in delicious partnership. A bit of coarse sugar on the exterior of the cookie adds a delicate crunch.  The coarse sugar is a lovely contrast to the mild saltiness of the miso.",
  "chocolate" : "This deeply chocolatey chip cookie includes a hint of coffee.  It is lightly crisp on the outside, tender on the inside.",
  "oatmeal" : "Butter is good - brown butter is better! This cookieâ€™s wonderful flavor is highlighted by a bit of sea salt.",
  "molasses" : "My most recent invention! These look like classic chocolate chip cookies but they are a delightful riff on an old favorite.  Sesame paste provides an earthy base note which blends beautifully with nutty buckwheat flour and a touch of molasses.",
  "peanut" : "Robust peanut butter flavor, not too sweet, shortbread texture . . . this is a favorite cookie to enjoy with a glass of milk.",
  "chocoshort" : "Rich chocolate chocolate chip shortbread is balanced with sea salt.  I add a bit of ground decaf espresso beans for added flavor.",
  "mandel" : "These buttery cookies are crisp all the way through, studded with toasted almonds and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.",
  "chococherries" : "This richness of this chocolate cookie is balanced by slightly tart dried cherries. Toasted pecans add a bit of nutty goodness."
